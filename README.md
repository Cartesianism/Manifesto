## Gratitude

Dear friends! On behalf of Ukraine and all its people, we thank you for your help in the fight against the aggressor! We know that wars today are won in the Internet space as well! Our victory and the freedom of millions of people depends on ours effective and a team work today!

## A call to join

We have created the "International Legion of Cyber Forces", we invite the best of the best to join: developers and experts, security specialists and architects, cyberpunks and fido veterans, darknet hackers and open source contributors, all IT specialists from our multinational and freedom-loving homeland and its friends from around the world. We call on you to stand guard over our country, Europe and world civilization. Help us protect millions and billions of lives! We need you!

## Problem

Now all IT specialists have united to stop the aggression against Ukraine, but we lack coordination. We cannot afford chaos during a war, we cannot allow critical tasks to be performed inefficiently, duplicated, frustrated due to lack of resources or competencies, and even worse, due to lack of coordination between us. We must establish such coordination in order to help each other, not to interfere. In order not to expose our goals, under the risk of sabotage by the enemy, to avoid danger for our specialists, and to hold deadlines, we need to clearly separate people who came anonymously from the Internet and people whose reliability is confirmed along the chain "I trust as myself" starting from the heads of state bodies of Ukraine. Everyone on the Internet should be able to work on non-critical tasks from open repositories, but not to have access to government goals and plans. Reliable specialists invited here through the chain of trust will have access to private repositories, and they will be required to have an appropriate attitude towards their tasks.

## Solution

I suggest using the tools that are publicly available and familiar to all specialists - these are git and Github. But, for our safety, please do it from new anonymous accounts. We must establish coordination in order to help each other, and not to interfere. I suggest that IT people may create a new anonymous and clear github accounts to join this organization. We will coordinate projects in a few private repositories. Github has all tools for planning (issues, milestones, kanban), discussions and coordinating messaging, splitting projects into stages and tasks, tracking the status of each issue. In addition, the github is quite secure, reliable, and can handle highly intensive traffic, it has built-in cryptography tools, including automatic electronic signature commiting each new line of code to the project. All tasks will be added to one list, grouped by labels, assigned to certain persons, so it will be possible to check who is already working on the task. We will be able to find colleagues, but we will not understand who exactly they are (working on the certain task), i.e. even if a stranger gets there, he will not be able to deanonymize other specialists, unless, of course, they deanonymize themselves. It is better to keep everything in English so that we can invite foreign colleagues as well. Each specialist must describe/register their competencies.
