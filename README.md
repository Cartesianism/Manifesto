# Manifesto

We must establish coordination in order to help each other, and not to interfere. I suggest that IT people may create a new anonymous and clear github account to join this organization. We will coordinate projects in a few private repositories. Github has all tools for planning (issues, milestones, kanban), discussions and coordinating, splitting projects into stages and tasks, tracking the status of each issue. In addition, the github is quite secure, reliable, and can handle highly intensive traffic, it has built-in cryptography tools, including automatic electronic signature commiting each new line of code to the project. All tasks will be added to one list, grouped by labels, assigned to persons, so it will be possible to check who is already working on the task. We will be able to find colleagues, but we will not understand who exactly they are (working on the certain task), i.e. even if a stranger gets there, he will not be able to deanonymize other specialists, unless, of course, they give deanonymize themselves. It is better to keep everything in English so that we can invite foreign colleagues as well. Each specialist must describe/register their competencies.
